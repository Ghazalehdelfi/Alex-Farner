"I‚Äôm delighted to announce that AI Fund has closed $190M for our new fund, in an oversubscribed round. I look forward to working with many more builders to create new companies that serve humanity.

AI Fund isn‚Äôt a traditional venture capital firm that invests in existing businesses. Instead, we are a venture builder (also called a venture studio): We co-found AI companies, so our team is directly involved in writing code, talking to customers to get feedback, iterating on product designs, preparing market analyses, and so on. We have a lot of fun building multiple AI products at a time, and thus live daily the emerging AI startup best practices.

Many factors go into the success of a startup. But if I had to pick just one, it would be speed. Startups live or die based on their ability to make good decisions and execute fast, which has been a recurring theme of my posts here as well.

If you are building an AI startup, here are some ideas to consider:
- A startup with a small team that pursues one focused, concrete idea can move really fast. Rather than hedging, it is often better to pursue one hypothesis (for example, build one concrete product) but also be willing to switch quickly to a different hypothesis (say, change what features you decide to build) if the data that comes back indicates the original hypothesis is flawed. Concreteness gets you speed!
- A subject matter expert‚Äôs gut is remarkably good at making quick decisions. Obviously, there‚Äôs a role for data and user studies as well. But if you‚Äôre deciding whether to build feature A or B, or to sell first to user persona X or Y, sometimes a domain expert‚Äôs gut will point to a quick decision that you can execute and validate or falsify. Trusting a domain expert‚Äôs gut gets you speed!
- AI-assisted coding is making prototyping faster than ever before. Yes, AI assistance is speeding up building reliable, enterprise-grade applications and maintaining legacy codebases. But the acceleration it brings to building stand-alone prototypes is far greater. This is because stand-alone prototypes have low requirements for reliability, integration, or even security (if, say, you run them in a sandbox environment). This lets us prototype and test at a ferocious velocity. AI-assisted coding (including vibe coding, where you might barely look at the code) gets you speed!
- Finally, with faster prototyping, the bottleneck shifts to getting feedback from users. A single learning cycle might consist of (i) building a prototype and (ii) getting user feedback to inform the next iteration. Since (i) is now much faster, accelerating (ii) is growing in importance. This means teams that are skilled at finding prospective customers and getting their feedback in hours/days rather than weeks can go faster. 

I‚Äôm grateful to AI Fund‚Äôs investors, team, and entrepreneur partners for working with us. There is much ahead to build!

"Mastering async in JavaScript isn‚Äôt optional anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs essential.

At some point, every frontend dev hits this wall:
You‚Äôre fetching data‚Ä¶
Things seem fine‚Ä¶
Then: ‚ÄúWhy is this value undefined?‚Äù
Or worse ‚Äî ‚ÄúUnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning‚Äù

Welcome to the world of Promises, async/await, and the event loop.

Here‚Äôs what helped me make sense of it:
 ‚Ä¢ async/await makes code look synchronous ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still async under the hood.
 ‚Ä¢ Not handling errors with try/catch? That‚Äôs a bug waiting to happen.
 ‚Ä¢ Forgetting await even once can break your logic in weird ways.
 ‚Ä¢ And yes ‚Äî Promise.all and Promise.race are power tools when used right.

The more you understand how JavaScript handles async behind the scenes, the easier it becomes to write code that just works ‚Äî especially when building UIs that depend on external data.

üß† If you can reason through an async bug in an interview, that‚Äôs a strong signal.

"Taking multi-object tracking to the next level with SAM2 üèÄüèÄüèÄ

Last year, I spent all of May building Football AI‚Äîthis time, I‚Äôm working on something cool with basketball.

One of the toughest challenges I‚Äôm facing while building Basketball AI is occlusions. Players frequently fight for position, blocking each other from view, which makes multi-object tracking (MOT) extremely difficult. 

Over the past few days, I‚Äôve been experimenting with using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for tracking‚Äîand the results blew my mind.

We're planning to add a SAM2-based tracker to the trackers library, and also enable automatic annotation of MOT datasets using SAM2.

You‚Äôll find links to my SAM2 tutorials and notebooks, as well as the Football AI project, in the comments below üëáüèª Basketball AI code and tutorial coming soon!

"AI‚Äôs ability to make tasks not just cheaper, but also faster, is underrated in its importance in creating business value.

For the task of writing code, AI is a game-changer. It takes so much less effort ‚Äî and is so much cheaper ‚Äî to write software with AI assistance than without. But beyond reducing the cost of writing software, AI is shortening the time from idea to working prototype, and the ability to test ideas faster is changing how teams explore and invent. When you can test 20 ideas per month, it dramatically changes what you can do compared to testing 1 idea per month. This is a benefit that comes from AI-enabled speed rather than AI-enabled cost reduction.

That AI-enabled automation can reduce costs is well understood. For example, providing automated customer service is cheaper than operating human-staffed call centers. Many businesses are more willing to invest in growth than just in cost savings; and, when a task becomes cheaper, some businesses will do a lot more of it, thus creating growth. But another recipe for growth is underrated: Making certain tasks much faster (whether or not they also become cheaper) can create significant new value.

I see this pattern across more and more businesses. Consider the following scenarios:
- If a lender can approve loans in minutes using AI, rather than days waiting for a human to review them, this creates more borrowing opportunities (and also lets the lender deploy its capital faster). Even if human-in-the-loop review is needed, using AI to get the most important information to the reviewer might speed things up. 
- If an academic institution gives homework feedback to students in minutes (via autograding) rather than days (via human grading), the rapid feedback facilitates better learning.
- If an online seller can approve purchases faster, this can lead to more sales. For example, many platforms that accept online ad purchases have an approval process that can take hours or days; if approvals can be done faster, they can earn revenue faster. This also enables customers to test ideas faster.
- If a company‚Äôs sales department can prioritize leads and respond to prospective customers in minutes or hours rather than days ‚Äî closer to when the customers‚Äô buying intent first led them to contact the company ‚Äî sales representatives might close more deals. Likewise, a business that can respond more quickly to requests for proposals may win more deals.

I‚Äôve written previously about looking at the tasks a company does to explore where AI can help. Many teams already do this with an eye toward making tasks cheaper, either to save costs or to do those tasks many more times. If you‚Äôre doing this exercise, consider also whether AI can significantly speed up certain tasks. One place to examine is the sequence of tasks on the path to earning revenue. If some of the steps can be sped up, perhaps this can help revenue growth.

"I‚Äôm an AI/ML Engineering Manager with more than 9+ years of experience.

‚Üí Sketch an end-to-end pipeline: ingestion ‚Üí features ‚Üí model ‚Üí serving ‚Üí monitoring.

‚Üí Spin up SageMaker or Vertex AI, register a model, deploy an endpoint, add CI/CD in GitHub Actions.
‚Üí Containerise a tiny FastAPI service that serves your model; push it to AWS ECR.

‚Üí Pick one domain (e.g. NLP or CV) and go deep: courses ‚Üí books ‚Üí papers ‚Üí small projects ‚Üí production clone.
‚Üí Certifications (AWS ML Specialty, etc.) are great frameworks - use them, then go beyond docs and experiment/hands-on.
‚Üí Ignore the noise of ‚Äú10 agent patterns in a weekend.‚Äù Reliable systems are not built overnight and no one knows everything.
