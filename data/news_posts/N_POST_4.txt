🔭🤖🌐 The AI space is vast and can feel overwhelming...until we start using abstractions to make sense of it! In my latest article "The Good-Enough Truth", we dive into the concept of the AI stack. 🧩

Just like the good old LAMP stack that powers WordPress, the AI stack is all about combining technologies to build applications. 🏢 It's all about finding your place in the stack, and deciding which tech will help you succeed. 

We've broken the AI stack down to 4 layers:
1️⃣ Infrastructure Layer: The hardware - GPUs, TPUs, cloud services.
2️⃣ Data Layer: The data needed to train models, and databases to store it.
3️⃣ Model and Orchestration Layer: The actual models and tools to build, deploy, and observe them.
4️⃣ Application Layer: The AI-powered applications used by customers.

Check out my full breakdown and let's make this complicated landscape a bit more navigable, together. 👇
