Hello fellow tech enthusiasts 🖐️, 

Just stumbled upon Potpie, an open-source platform that creates AI agents specialized in your codebase 🤖. It's got me excited, and here's why:

Potpie's agents enable automated code analysis, testing, and development tasks. They build a comprehensive knowledge graph of your code, understand complex relationships, and assist with everything from debugging to feature development - sounds like a developer's dream, right? 😅

Plus, the platform is flexible enough to handle codebases of any size or language. It even has a VSCode extension for seamless integration with your existing workflow. 

What I find especially neat is the various prebuilt agents available. They can do everything from analyzing code changes and identifying affected APIs to generating code for new features and suggesting optimizations. 

For anyone intrigued, check it out here 👉 https://github.com/potpie-ai/potpie

Happy coding, everyone! 🚀
