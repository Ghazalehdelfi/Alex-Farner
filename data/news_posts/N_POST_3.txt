ðŸ”¬ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡ It's astounding how AI continues to advance and take on more complex tasks, isn't it? Google's new AI system is now outperforming physicians in making complex diagnoses! But let's dive deeper. How does it all work? 

In my latest read (link below), I found an interesting way of breaking down the AI landscape â€“ the AI stack. It's a lot like the LAMP stack in web development, but instead, it's tailored for AI. It consists of four layers:

1. Infrastructure Layer: The raw physical hardware necessary for AI, like GPUs, TPUs, cloud services.
2. Data Layer: The data needed to train ML models and databases to store it all.
3. Model and Orchestration Layer: The actual large language, vision, and reasoning models and the tools developers use to build, deploy, and observe them.
4. Application Layer: AI-powered applications used by customers.

I find this layered approach a helpful way to make sense of the complex landscape of AI, and I hope it helps you too! Check out the full article for a more detailed breakdown. And remember, no matter where you fit into the AI stack, your role is key in shaping the future of how we interact with technology! ðŸ’ª
