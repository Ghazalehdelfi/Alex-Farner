Ensemble methods 🤝 The strength in numbers game! But easy to forget: it's a tricky balance ⚖️ in production. Ensemble models can drastically improve accuracy 🎯 but at a cost. 

They're computationally intensive ⚙️🔥 and can slow down inferencing times, not ideal for real-time applications ⏱️. Plus, maintaining multiple models simultaneously is a logistics nightmare 😱. 

Tradeoff pattern? Boosting accuracy vs. managing complexity and speed. If you can afford the latency and have resources to manage the logistics, go for it. Otherwise, carefully consider your options 🤔.

Lesson learned the hard way: Ensemble methods aren't a one-size-fits-all solution! 🚫👕👖
