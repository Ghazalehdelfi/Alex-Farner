Tip: A/B testing is a crucial part of the MLOps lifecycle 🔄. But, it's easy to overlook the "B" part - the baseline model. 😅

A non-obvious insight? Always have a simple, reliable model as your baseline. This isn't just for comparison 📊, it's also your fail-safe option. In case your sophisticated ML model fails for unforeseen reasons, the baseline model can keep things running smoothly 🏃‍♂️.

But here's the trade-off 🔄: maintaining an additional model requires effort, adds complexity and could also introduce subtle bugs 🐛. However, when you weigh it against the potential cost of downtime, it's worth it. Real-world ML isn't just about high accuracy, but also about reliability and robustness 💪.

Remember, your baseline model is not just a benchmark, it's your safety net too! 🚀
