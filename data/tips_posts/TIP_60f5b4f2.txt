Here's a hard-earned insight for real-time data processing: Always design for idempotence and out-of-order data arrival. In a perfect world, data would always arrive in the order it was produced and never get duplicated. But we don't live in a perfect world.

Real-world systems often yield duplicate or out-of-sequence data due to network retries, system failures, or design flaws. It can cripple your downstream processing if you're not prepared. 

Design your event processing to be idempotent â€” able to process the same data multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. Create your systems to handle data surplus and sequence anomalies gracefully. 

Tradeoff? It adds complexity. You'll need to include metadata like event timestamps, and use algorithms, like watermarking, that can handle out-of-order data. But ignore this and you'll pay a heavier price when data anomalies lead to erroneous analytics or crashed applications. It's rework, debugging, and headaches you don't need.

Don't underestimate the chaos of real-world data. Design for idempotence and out-of-order arrival from the start.
