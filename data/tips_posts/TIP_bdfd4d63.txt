💡Tip: Don't underestimate the value of tracking compound performance metrics. While it's tempting to rely on simple, standalone metrics, they often don't paint the full picture. 🎨 

In production, we found that tracking compound metrics such as precision@k or AUC provided a much more realistic view of our models' performance. 🎯 It’s not just about a single, static accuracy figure, but the entire distribution of predictions. 📊 

However, beware ⚠️: compound metrics can mask issues if not used wisely. For instance, a high AUC might hide the fact that the top predictions (which might be the most used in your application) are totally wrong.

Always pair compound metrics with relevant standalone ones. It's an art to balance these to get a true compass of your model's performance. 🧭
