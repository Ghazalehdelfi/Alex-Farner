📊 Monitoring & Observability in ML systems is a tricky business. One hard-learned insight: Expensive data ingestion pipelines 🔁 can be a major cost sink. 

💡Tradeoff alert: High-frequency metrics vs. Cost! Do we need to track every minor model parameter change? Probably not. 🙅‍♂️ 

✅ Opt for a tiered approach: High-frequency logging for critical parameters, and lower frequency for less critical ones. This can save significant costs without compromising system integrity. 

⚠️ Watch out! This pattern isn't a silver bullet. Log less, miss anomalies? 🚫 Ensure your tiering strategy aligns with the operational criticality of parameters. 

🧩 The real game: Balancing cost optimization with robust observability. Now that's a puzzle worth solving! 🤓
