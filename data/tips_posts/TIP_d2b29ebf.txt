MLOps tip inbound 🚀: Model serving optimization isn't just about speed⏱️, it's about balance⚖️. High throughput is critical, but don't overlook model footprint, especially when deploying multiple models simultaneously🏞️. 

🕵️‍♂️Hidden complexity: Memory consumption. Some models eat RAM for breakfast! Large models can impact other services, causing system-wide slowdowns or even crashes🔥. 

🔀Tradeoff: Throughput vs. footprint. Consider strategies like model distillation or pruning to manage this delicate balance⛓️. 

💡Experience speaks: We once faced a major service outage due to a bloated model. Post-mortem revealed we'd overlooked memory footprint during initial deployment. Lesson learned, the hard way! 

Remember: Optimizing ML models is not just about speed, it's a multi-factor balancing act. Keep a keen eye on those memory footprints! 👀
