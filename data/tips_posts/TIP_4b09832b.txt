Data quality can make or break your ML systems. But, here's what they don't tell you: having data quality monitoring only at the ETL stage is a recipe for disaster. Yes, it's essential, but itâ€™s not enough. Monitoring should be an inherent part of your ML pipeline, not just a feature of your data ingestion process.

Experience taught me this: data doesn't remain static. It drifts, it degrades. Features evolve. Without robust in-pipeline data quality checks, you can end up training on garbage, subtly undermining your models until they fail in prod. A stitch in time saves nine.

Build quality checks and alerts directly into your data pipelines. Monitor feature distributions, missing values, outliers. Compare live data to historical data. Be proactive, not reactive.

Remember, data quality isn't a one-time checkbox, it's a continuous process. Your ML pipeline's health is only as good as the quality of your data flowing through it. Don't learn this the hard way.
