It is the next industrial revolution. \n\nCheck out the incredible scope and speed of what our team is delivering:\n\n\ud83c\udfed Unprecedented scale: At 4 million square feet across 8 buildings, and 1.2 Gigawatt total capacity \u2014 that's roughly one-quarter of the entire data center capacity of Northern Virginia in a single location! Each building can operate up to 50,000 NVIDIA GB200s.\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f Record-breaking speed: From a barren field in June 2024, the initial 206MW phase is on track to be energized in the first half of 2025. This velocity, fueled by our in-house manufacturing and nearly 3,000 daily on-site workers, is unheard of for a greenfield project of this magnitude.\n\n\ud83c\udf43 An energy-first approach by design:\n\u27a1\ufe0f Strategically located to harness Abilene's abundant, low-cost wind energy.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Features direct-to-chip liquid cooling with a zero-water evaporation, closed-loop system.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Bringing our own power onsite by building a 300 MW natural gas plant for backup power instead of traditional diesel. \n\n\ud83c\udf0e Economic Powerhouse: According to DevelopAbilene, the initial phase alone (Buildings 1 and 2) is projected to bring ~$1 billion in economic impact to Abilene over 20 years, with the full project creating over 400 full-time American AI jobs. \n\nWe're not just building data centers; we're advancing American AI leadership with infrastructure powered by American energy and built with American labor.\n\nHuge thanks to our CEO Chase Lochmiller, Abeline Mayor Weldon Hurt,\nand incredible partners Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital Infrastructure.\n\nRead the full Bloomberg feature by Shirin Ghaffary, Brody Ford, and Emily Chang: https://lnkd.in/dRSqnTYF ", "likes": "477", "comments": "9 comments", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T22:19:02.646778", "total_engagement": 486}, {"content": "\ud83d\ude80 Scale DeepSeek-R1 in production with Together Reasoning Clusters\n\nSince launching DeepSeek-R1, we\u2019ve seen a surge of companies looking to deploy reasoning models in production\u2014but scaling them efficiently remains a challenge.\n\nToday, we\u2019re expanding beyond our ultra-fast Serverless API with Together Reasoning Clusters: dedicated, high-performance compute built for large-scale, low-latency inference.\n\nTogether Reasoning Clusters include: \n\n\u2705 Speeds up to 110 tokens/sec with no rate limits or resource sharing\n\u2705 Custom optimizations fine-tuned for your traffic profile\n\u2705 Predictable pricing for cost-effective scaling\n\u2705 Enterprise SLAs with 99.9% uptime\n\u2705 Secure deployments with full control over your data\n\nReasoning Clusters run on the same Together Inference Stack that powers our ultra-fast DeepSeek-R1 671B endpoint\u20142x faster than anything else available today.\n\nOn our dedicated reasoning clusters, we\u2019re achieving speeds of up to 110 tokens/sec, thanks to fine-tuned configurations and custom-trained speculators.\n\nWhether you're getting started, scaling fast, or running mission-critical workloads, we provide the best performance at every stage.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Looking to deploy DeepSeek-R1 in production?
